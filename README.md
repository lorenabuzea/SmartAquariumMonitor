# Smart Aquarium Monitor

The Smart Aquarium Monitor collects real-time data from an Arduino equipped with multiple sensors. It displays key water quality metrics, including:

- **Turbidity**
- **Temperature**
- **Light**
- **Depth**

The system provides an interactive interface to assess whether the aquarium conditions are suitable for its inhabitants as it reads data directly from the Arduino port.
